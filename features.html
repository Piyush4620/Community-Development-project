      <h1>Phishing attacks:</h1>
      <p> This is the most common way of hacking. Most of the people having less technical knowledge can easily be a victim of this attack. The hacker who uses the phishing technique to hack need not to be have a lot of technical knowledge like networking, using hacking tools etc. That’s why the number of such attacks is remarkably more than other hacking attacks
	The phishing attacks are the practice of sending fraudulent
message or communication that appears to come from  a reputable source. The goal of such attack is to steal the personal information or to to install the malware on the victim’s machine.

      <h1>Email phishing</h1>
      <p> Most phishing attacks are sent by email.
         The crook will register a fake domain that mimics a genuine organisation and sends thousands out thousands of generic requests.
         The fake domain often involves character substitution, like using ‘r’ and ‘n’ next to each other to create ‘rn’ instead of ‘m’.
         Alternatively, they might use the organisation’s name in the local part of the email address (such as paypal@domainregistrar.com)
         in the hopes that the sender’s name will simply appear as ‘PayPal’ in the recipient’s inbox.
         There are many ways to spot a phishing email, but as a general rule, you should always check the email address
         of a message that asks you to click a link or download a attachment. </p>

      <h1>Spear phishing</h1>
      <p>There are two other, more sophisticated, types of phishing involving email.
        The first, spear phishing, describes malicious emails sent to a specific person.
         Criminals who do this will already have some or all of the following information about the victim:<br>

Their name; <br>
Place of employment; <br>
Job title; <br>
Email address; and<br>
Specific information about their job role.<br>
One of the most famous data breaches in recent history, the hacking of the Democratic National Committee, was done with the help of spear phishing.</p>

      <h1>Whaling</h1>
      <p>Whaling attacks are even more targeted, taking aim at senior executives. Although the end goal of whaling is the same as any other kind of phishing attack, the technique tends to be a lot subtler.

Tricks such as fake links and malicious URLs aren’t useful in this instance, as criminals are attempting to imitate senior staff.

Scams involving bogus tax returns are an increasingly common variety of whaling. Tax forms are highly valued by criminals as they contain a host of useful information: names, addresses, Social Security numbers and bank account information. </p>

      <h1> Smishing and vishing</h1>
      <p>With both smishing and vishing, telephones replace emails as the method of communication. Smishing involves criminals sending text messages (the content of which is much the same as with email phishing), and vishing involves a telephone conversation.

A common vishing scam involves a criminal posing as a fraud investigator (either from the card company or the bank) telling the victim that their account has been breached.

The criminal will then ask the victim to provide payment card details to verify their identity or to transfer money into a ‘secure’ account – by which they mean the criminal’s account.</p>

      <h1>Angler phishing</h1>
      <p> A relatively new attack vector, social media offers a number of ways for criminals to trick people. Fake URLs; cloned websites, posts, and tweets; and instant messaging (which is essentially the same as smishing) can all be used to persuade people to divulge sensitive information or download malware.

Alternatively, criminals can use the data that people willingly post on social media to create highly targeted attacks. </p>
